## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!

Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data. This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.

## üìÇ Dataset
Danny has shared with you 2 key datasets for this case study:

### **```plan```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The plan table shows which plans customer can choose to join Foodie-Fi when they first sign up.

* **Trial:** can sign up to an initial 7 day free trial will automatically continue with the pro monthly subscription plan unless they cancel

* **Basic plan:** limited access and can only stream user videos
* **Pro plan** no watch time limits and video are downloadable with 2 subscription options: **monthly** and **annually**


| "plan_id" | "plan_name"     | "price" |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| 0         | "trial"         | 0.00    |
| 1         | "basic monthly" | 9.90    |
| 2         | "pro monthly"   | 19.90   |
| 3         | "pro annual"    | 199.00  |
| 4         | "churn"         | NULL    |


</details>


### **```subscriptions```**


<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

Customer subscriptions show the exact date where their specific ```plan_id``` starts.

If customers downgrade from a pro plan or cancel their subscription - the higher plan will remain in place until the period is over - the ```start_date``` in the ```subscriptions``` table will reflect the date that the actual plan changes.

In this part, I will display the first 20 rows of this dataset since the original one is super long:


| "customer_id" | "plan_id" | "start_date" |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| 1             | 0         | "2020-08-01" |
