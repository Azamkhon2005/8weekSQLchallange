<p align="center">

## üõ†Ô∏è Problem Statement

> Danny was scrolling through his Instagram feed when something really caught his eye - ‚Äú80s Retro Styling and Pizza Is The Future!‚Äù
> 
> Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so **Pizza Runner** was launched!
> 
> Danny started by recruiting ‚Äúrunners‚Äù to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny‚Äôs house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

## üìÇ Dataset
Danny has shared with you 6 key datasets for this case study:

### **```runners```**
<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

The runners table shows the **```registration_date```** for each new runner.


|runner_id|registration_date|
|---------|-----------------|
|1        |1/1/2021         |
|2        |1/3/2021         |
|3        |1/8/2021         |
|4        |1/15/2021        |

</details>


### **```customer_orders```**

<details>
<summary>
View table
</summary>

Customer pizza orders are captured in the **```customer_orders```** table with 1 row for each individual pizza that is part of the order.

|order_id|customer_id|pizza_id|exclusions|extras|order_time        |
|--------|---------|--------|----------|------|------------------|

### **```runner_orders```**

After each orders are received through the system - they are assigned to a runner - however not all orders are fully completed and can be cancelled by the restaurant or the customer.

The **```pickup_time```** is the timestamp at which the runner arrives at the Pizza Runner headquarters to pick up the freshly cooked pizzas. 

The **```distance```** and **```duration```** fields are related to how far and long the runner had to travel to deliver the order to the respective customer.



|order_id|runner_id|pickup_time|distance  |duration|cancellation      |

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Data Preprocessing

### **Data Issues**

Data issues in the existing schema include:

* **```customer_orders``` table**
  - ```null``` values entered as text
  - using both ```NaN``` and ```null``` values
* **```runner_orders``` table**
  - ```null``` values entered as text
  - using both ```NaN``` and ```null``` values
  - units manually entered in ```distance``` and ```duration``` columns

### **Data Cleaning**

**```customer_orders```**
- Converting ```null``` and ```NaN``` values into blanks ```''``` in ```exclusions``` and ```extras```
  - Blanks indicate that the customer requested no extras/exclusions for the pizza, whereas ```null``` values would be ambiguous.
- Saving the transformations in a temporary table
  - We want to avoid permanently changing the raw data via ```UPDATE``` commands if possible.

**```runner_orders```**

- Converting ```'null'``` text values into null values for ```pickup_time```, ```distance``` and ```duration```
- Extracting only numbers and decimal spaces for the distance and duration columns
  - Use regular expressions and ```NULLIF``` to convert non-numeric entries to null values
- Converting blanks, ```'null'``` and ```NaN``` into null values for cancellation
- Saving the transformations in a temporary table

**Result:**
